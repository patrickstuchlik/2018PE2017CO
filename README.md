# 2018PE2017CO

Hello! This repo contains material intended to be used with the [NCHS Vital Statistics Period/Cohort Linked Birth-Infant Death Data Files](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data_access/vitalstatsonline.htm), specifically the 2018 period/2017 cohort public use data file. Using the [documentation](https://ftp.cdc.gov/pub/Health_Statistics/NCHS/Dataset_Documentation/DVS/period-cohort-linked/18PE17CO_linkedUG.pdf), and the record layout, I created a "data dictionary," that can be helpful for importing such a large data set. I've also included the **R** code I used to download, unzip, and import the data, and then to create the linked cohort dataset and reproduce the applicable Table 2 in the documentation.
